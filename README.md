# FasterRCNN_VehicleDetection
# Introduction
I want to introduce Faster RCNN model with Resnet50_fpn_v2.The data is here: https://universe.roboflow.com/lynkeus03/vehicle-detection-by9xs/dataset/3/download with format Pascal VOC.
This model could be used to detect motorbike, car, bus, pickup-van, micro-bus, truck.
